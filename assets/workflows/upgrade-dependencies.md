Dependency upgrade request, started from the workflow menu. Follow the normal ODD flow: read the current versions and the changelogs of what will change before touching anything. Dependency commands ask through the guard; run only the ones this request needs.

- Packages: {{packages}}
- Allowed range: {{range}}
- Verification: {{verify}}

Stay inside the allowed range: "Patch" means patch releases only, "Minor" means minor and patch, "Major" allows breaking releases. A group is one package together with its peer and type packages (for example `react`, `react-dom`, and `@types/react`), or one ecosystem family. State your grouping before starting, then upgrade one group at a time, whatever the range. Run the verification after each group and stop at the first failure, reporting which package caused it. Commit by work unit, following the `brigadev-work-unit-commits` skill.

Dependency changes are high-risk item 5: end with `Risk: item 5 (dependency changes)`, so an independent `brigadev-verify` runs after the change's own checks.
