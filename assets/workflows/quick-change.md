Quick change request, started from the workflow menu. This is a Small task: work inline, test first when a deterministic test applies, in one work unit and its commit, and never create a feature document or a plan.

- What to change: {{what}}
- Area or files: {{area}}

If the change turns out to need more than that (several work units, a contract change, a decision for the user, or more than a few files), stop and say so instead of growing it.
