Bug fix request, started from the workflow menu. Follow the normal ODD flow: reproduce the problem first, add a failing regression test when a deterministic one applies, fix the root cause, then run the tests.

- Where it happens: {{where}}
- Environment: {{environment}}
- Steps to reproduce: {{steps}}
- Expected: {{expected}}
- Actual (errors or logs): {{actual}}
- Ticket or link: {{ticket}}

If the problem cannot be reproduced from the details above, report what was tried instead of guessing at a fix.
