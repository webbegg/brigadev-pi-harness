PR feedback request, started from the workflow menu. Read the comments on the pull request, then handle them one by one. Write every reply with the `brigadev-comment-writer` skill: short, warm, direct.

- Pull request: {{pr}}
- Comments to handle: {{which}}
- Mode: {{mode}}

When no pull request is given, run `gh pr list --author @me --state open --json number,title,url,updatedAt,reviewDecision` and show the list. With no PR, say so and ask for a PR number in your reply, then stop. With 1 to 5 PRs, call `ask_user_choice` with one option per PR (`#number title`) and free text for another PR; with only 1 PR, add the option "Another PR". With more than 5, offer the 5 most recently updated plus free text.

"Fix and draft replies" means: before changing code, if the chosen PR is not the current branch, switch to its branch only when the working tree is clean (otherwise stop and say so), and stop if the PR's head is in another repository (a fork; check with `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName,isCrossRepository`). Then make the requested changes as work units with their tests, committed by the usual rules, and draft a reply to each comment. "Draft replies only" means change no code and post nothing: show the drafted replies for approval. Replies are drafts until the user approves them; pushing and posting replies go through the guard.
