Review request, started from the workflow menu. Use the `brigadev-review` skill: review one frozen change with the 4R lenses that fit its risk, and save the ledger to the `reviews/` folder of the repo docs folder. This is a review only; do not change the code.

- Target: {{target}}
- Focus: {{focus}}
- Pay attention to: {{notes}}

When no target is given, review the current branch against its default branch. "All fitting lenses" means let the risk of the change pick the lenses; any other focus names the lens to weigh first.
