## When to use

Load before deciding what goes into each commit or PR: committing ODD work, splitting a feature into reviewable commits, or preparing chained PRs.

## Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Commit by work unit | One commit = one deliverable behavior, fix, migration, or docs unit. |
| Not by file type | Never `models`, then `services`, then `tests` when none works alone. |
| Tests with code | Tests go in the same commit as the behavior they verify. |
| Docs with the change | Docs go with the user-visible change they explain. |
| High risk alone | A unit whose Risk line names a high-risk item gets its own commit. |
| Story | A reviewer understands why the commit exists from its diff and message. |
| Budget is not code-golf | Never delete comments, blank lines, docs, or tests, or compress code, to fit ~400 lines. Slice by unit or report the overage. |

## Checklist before each commit

- [ ] One clear purpose.
- [ ] The repo builds and tests pass with only this commit applied.
- [ ] Tests and docs for this unit are included when relevant.
- [ ] Rolling it back does not revert unrelated work.
- [ ] The message explains the outcome, not the file list.

## Message format

Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`, with `type` in `feat | fix | docs | refactor | perf | test | build | ci | chore | style | revert` and `!` for breaking changes. No `Co-Authored-By` trailers unless the user asks.

| Weak | Better |
| --- | --- |
| `add models` | `feat(auth): add token validation model and tests` |
| `add tests` | tests included with each behavior commit |

## ODD relationship

- Slices of about 400 authored changed lines hold one or more whole tasks with their tests and docs.
- Record the commit that holds each task in the feature document's `## Tasks`.
- When the running count passes ~400 lines, load `brigadev-chained-pr`.

## Commands

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
git log --oneline -5   # match the repository's message style
```
